textconv.vim
============

Easily apply text conversions. 

I found `this discussion on Reddit`_ about the pain of sanitizing plaintext
when pasting from utf-eager applications where romainl swings to the rescue
with some pastebins of vimscripts to easily accomplish that very thing. I
cleaned them up and bundled them into this plugin.

The plugin provides commands for converting to+from html entites and
url-encoded strings.
